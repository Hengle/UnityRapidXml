# UnityRapidXml
this is a simple wrapper for rapidxml(http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) for C#.
it is the fastest xml parser in C#, i crate this library because the default xml parser in c# is too swollen and slow.
in Unity Engine, there is a Mono.xml you can use. but is also slow. 
this library is implemented in native, and easy use in c#.
you can clone or download this project to see the detail.
i have test it on windows,android and ios. you can use it for your unity game.
